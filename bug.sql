The SQL query uses a function in the WHERE clause that is not deterministic. This can lead to unpredictable results, especially when the query is optimized by the database engine.  Consider this example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE RAND() < 0.5;
```

The `RAND()` function generates a random number between 0 and 1.  Because it's non-deterministic, the query might return different rows each time it's executed, even if the underlying data hasn't changed.  The database may choose to evaluate the `RAND()` function only once for the entire query, leading to unexpected filtering.
